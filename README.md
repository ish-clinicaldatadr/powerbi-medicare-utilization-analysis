## Medicare Inpatient Care Utilization, Spending, and Patient Burden (2016–2021)

## Project Summary
This project analyzes Medicare inpatient care patterns in the United States using publicly available CMS data.  
The dashboard supports **healthcare utilization and operations analysis** by examining trends in inpatient admissions, spending, length of stay, and patient cost-sharing burden across time and population subgroups. The analysis is descriptive and exploratory, without causal inference.

# Key Analytical Insights
- Medicare inpatient admissions declined sharply in 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 period.
- Despite fewer hospitalizations, average length of stay increased, indicating higher care intensity among hospitalized beneficiaries.
- Spending per inpatient admission increased over time, contributing to sustained inpatient spending despite reduced utilization.
- Patient cost-sharing through coinsurance and deductibles represents a substantial and persistent financial burden for hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries.
- Inpatient utilization is predominantly driven by short-stay acute hospitals under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which constitute the majority of Medicare Part A inpatient care.
- Drill-down analysis highlights the comparatively smaller but distinct role of special-category hospitals in inpatient utilization.
- Geographic variation in Medicare inpatient utilization is relatively modest across states, reflecting the standardized nature of Medicare Part A coverage and reimbursement.
